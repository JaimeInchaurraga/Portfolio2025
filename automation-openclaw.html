              <h1>My experience with OpenClaw</h1>
              <p>
                After two weeks using (and honestly wrestling with) OpenClaw, I can finally say I have a solid, working setup.
                In this post I’ll share the key lessons from the process, the main configurations (including the models I’m running),
                what I’m using it for today, and the next steps I’m taking.
              </p>
            </header>

            <!-- OVERVIEW -->
            <h2>So… what is OpenClaw?</h2>

            <p>
              Before it was called Moltbot, and it went through a few names, but in simple terms it is an agent running at computer level.
              The easiest way to explain it is this:
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>It is an AI assistant that does not just answer you. It can actually act inside your machine.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              A slightly more technical but still simple explanation would be this.
              OpenClaw is a runtime that connects a language model with tools and system access.
              The model thinks. The runtime interprets. The tools execute. And the workspace defines how everything behaves.
            </p>

            <h2>How it is built (in layers)</h2>

            <p>
              It is built in layers. You have the model, the runtime, the gateway, the workspace, and the tools.
              I know it can sound like a lot, but if you see it as a stack, it becomes very intuitive.
            </p>

            <p>
              Here is the simple version of what each layer does:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>The model</strong> is the brain. You can connect different models, either via API (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) or locally using something like Ollama. Later I’ll explain the tradeoffs and what I’m using right now.</li>
              <li><strong>The runtime</strong> is the engine. It sends the context and conversation to the model, reads the structured output, decides when to call tools, and applies the rules you define.</li>
              <li><strong>The gateway</strong> keeps the agent alive and reachable. It lets you connect channels like Telegram and talk to your assistant while it runs in the background.</li>
              <li><strong>The workspace</strong> is where everything lives: identity files, rules, tools, context documents and logs. These documents are critical because every message you send also includes these docs as input tokens to the model.</li>
              <li><strong>The tools</strong> are what make this real. Without tools, it is just chat. With tools, it can access files, send emails, create calendar events, modify sheets, browse the web, and more.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              If I had to use a simple analogy:
              the model is the brain, the runtime is the nervous system, the workspace is memory and personality,
              the tools are the hands, and the gateway is the phone line.
            </p>

            <h2>How everything connects</h2>

            <p>
              This is the mental model that helped me the most:
            </p>

            <pre><code>        YOU (Telegram / CLI)
                 |
                 v
              GATEWAY
                 |
                 v
              RUNTIME
         (rules + memory)
                 |
                 v
              MODEL
      (Haiku / Opus / Local)
                 |
        +--------+--------+
        |                 |
        v                 v
     TOOLS            WORKSPACE
 (Gmail, FS, etc.)   (Context docs)</code></pre>

            <!-- INSTALLATION -->
            <h2>Installation mindset</h2>

            <p>
              There are basically three ways to run this:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>On a remote server</li>
              <li>On your own machine</li>
              <li>On your machine but dockerized</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              In my case, I installed it directly on my machine. Bare metal.
              Yes, maybe slightly crazy. But it was intentional.
              My mindset was lean and UAT focused.
              I did not want to spend 1000 hours building a perfect infrastructure for something I did not fully understand yet.
              I wanted to test fast and learn fast. If it did not fit my workflow, I could stop without having overinvested in setup.
            </p>

            <p>
              That said, I wasn’t stupid either. And here comes the important part.
            </p>

            <h2>Wait, what is the danger?</h2>

            <p>
              When you run an agent locally, you are giving it access to your system.
              Your files. Your data. Whatever permissions you decide to grant.
              A bad execution could cost you.
            </p>

            <p>
              So I went very slowly.
            </p>

            <!-- SANDBOX -->
            <h2>Sandbox first</h2>

            <p>
              At the beginning I gave access to one single folder and started with read only.
              Then limited write access. Then very small, very controlled tasks.
              I invested a lot of time writing detailed context documents with clear boundaries and rules.
              This is extremely important because those documents are sent as tokens to the model on every interaction.
              Bad instructions mean unpredictable behaviour.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also did stress testing. Real ones.
              I asked it to do things it was not allowed to do. I tried to push it outside the sandbox.
              I even tried begging it to ignore constraints just to see how it reacted.
              Honestly, in general, I was pleasantly surprised. Not perfect, but much better than I expected.
            </p>

            <p>
              On top of that, I added contingency measures, just in case:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Backups of important folders</li>
              <li>Version snapshots of the workspace</li>
              <li>Logs for key actions</li>
              <li>Incremental permission expansion, never full access from day one</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- MODELS -->
            <h2>Model selection: API vs local</h2>

            <p>
              This part took time. I tested several local models and several API models.
              The one I liked the most was Anthropic, especially Opus. It is honestly impressive.
              But there is one thing you have to keep in mind: price.
              These models are expensive, and using them via API is significantly more expensive than having a standard subscription.
            </p>

            <p>
              After many variations, I decided to go for a multi model setup.
              My current stack looks like this:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Base model: Haiku</strong>.
                It is not huge in terms of parameters, but it is very agile, works well with tools and supports vision.
                For me, vision was important. I wanted the agent to understand images and extract useful info from them.
                It is also much cheaper, roughly three times cheaper than Sonnet. For daily tasks, it is perfect.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Critical layer: Opus</strong>.
                This one is reserved for complex reasoning, long context tasks and code heavy work.
                It is powerful, but I only use it when really necessary.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Local fallback: Ollama</strong>.
                Setting this up was not easy. Running a local model sounds great, but your hardware carries everything.
                The advantages are clear: no internet needed, no API cost, offline backup.
                The downsides are also clear: you need a strong machine, it consumes resources and disk space.
                One key lesson here is to check that the model has the <strong>tools</strong> tag in the Ollama library.
                Without tool support, it simply will not work properly as an agent.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- USE CASES -->
            <h2>What do I use it for?</h2>

            <p>
              As I said before, everything started in a sandbox. Only after passing tests did I expand.
              Here are some of the main things I do today.
            </p>

            <h3>Communication via Telegram</h3>
            <p>
              The process is simple. You create a bot, validate the token, connect it to OpenClaw.
              As long as the gateway is running, I can talk to my assistant from anywhere.
              There is something very powerful about being at the gym, sending a task to your assistant,
              and knowing it is executing while you train.
            </p>

            <h3>Analysis and organization of my computer</h3>
            <p>
              I gave access very gradually. Now it understands my project structure, my automation experiments and even my interests.
              I can ask it to reorganize folders, analyze documents, extract insights or suggest productivity improvements based on what it sees.
            </p>

            <h3>Productivity analysis</h3>
            <p>
              For the last few weeks I have been working on a structured productivity system where I track time spent on work and personal tasks,
              goals and counters. Axis, which is the name of my assistant, analyzes trends, compares time ranges and extracts insights about habits and evolution.
              Some of the insights have been genuinely useful.
            </p>

            <h3>Recurring tasks</h3>
            <p>
              One of my favorite features is scheduling recurring intelligent tasks. For example:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Once a week it checks for new versions of OpenClaw, compares them with mine and analyzes potential risks.</li>
              <li>Daily it generates structured logs of key learnings and actions from our sessions.</li>
              <li>Every fifteen days it reviews asset prices in a portfolio and extracts insights about growth or decline.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The possibilities here are almost infinite.
            </p>

            <h3>Gmail, Calendar and Drive</h3>
            <p>
              Using the Google tools integration, it can analyze emails, draft responses, send them, create events, modify Sheets and create Drive files.
              But again, this is sensitive. So I applied the same sandbox logic: activate one app at a time, read first, write later,
              test copies, stress test, and only then expand.
            </p>

            <h3>Web navigation</h3>
            <p>
              It can browse, scrape and structure data. Imagine the potential when that is combined with automation and scheduled tasks.
            </p>

            <!-- SECURITY -->
            <h2>Security</h2>

            <p>
              Not everything is perfect. There have been important security concerns, especially around prompt injection and third party extensions.
              Weaker models are more vulnerable. Also, some community skills or tools may not be secure.
            </p>

            <p>
              My personal opinion is simple. Use official tools from the OpenClaw author whenever possible. Be extremely cautious with external extensions.
            </p>

            <!-- CLOSING -->
            <h2>What’s next?</h2>

            <p>
              Right now I am working on other applications built on top of this stack, but I will share that in future posts.
            </p>

            <p>
              And genuinely, I am curious. Have you tried it seriously? Not as a trendy experiment, but actually building with it, testing it step by step.
              I am very interested in hearing real experiences from people who are also exploring this space.
            </p>
